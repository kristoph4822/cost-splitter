# Debt Resolver
GUI Java app for resolving debt within group. 

Two algorithms, which can be chosen. First one resolves debt separetly between each person (like standard Splitwise). Second one reduces number of transactions between **n** persons to **n-1** (like Splitwise "simplify debt" feature).

You can add weight to each person (i.e. specific person didn't participate in the whole trip).

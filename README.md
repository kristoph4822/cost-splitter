# Debt Resolver
Console app for resolving debt within group.

Two algorithms, which can be chosen with run argument. First one resolves debt separetly between each person (like standard Splitwise). Second one reduces number of transactions between **n** persons to **n-1** (kind of like Splitwise "simplify debt" feature).

You can add weight to each person (i.e. specific person didn't participate in the whole trip).
